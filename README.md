# Introducing ZKNOX
 

 
## Advancing Hardware Security & Cryptography.

Today, we‚Äôre excited to introduce ZKNOX, a new venture founded by three experts in hardware security and cryptography (ECC, ZK, MPC). With deep expertise in securing critical systems, our mission is to advance secure hardware, cryptographic protocols, and blockchain-integrated security solutions‚Äîwith a strong alignment to Ethereum and decentralized technologies.

We‚Äôre bringing deep expertise and innovation to every challenge on the whole security chain, from user end (be it secure enclaves, hardware wallets), back end (TEE, HSMs) or on-chain (smart contracts).

Stay tuned for updates as we share insights, breakthroughs, and product developments. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more, reach out to us‚Äîwe‚Äôre just getting started.
